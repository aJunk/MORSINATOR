# Morsinator

This repository contains the design files and code for the MORSINATOR.
The MORSINATOR is a morse code transceiver developed for application in scout group activities.

## Overview
The MORSINATOR is an RS485-based Hardware interface for transmitting morse code over several hundred meters across twin telecom/telephone wiring.

It does not transmit data, just high and low pulses.

## Future development

The board contains space and components for integrating an ESP32C3 microcontroller. It can Intercept the user input and line output.
It can be used to automate message sending and receiving, coordinate between stations, and more.

Code for it is not finished yet and will be added once in a presentable state.
